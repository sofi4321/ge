    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>-Conditional sentences have two parts or clauses that give a condition in the dependent clause and a result in the independent clause. The condition clause usually contains an if statement. There are several different forms of conditional sentences that allow the writer to express various meanings using different tenses.</p><//b>
    <p>• Condition (if) clause + result clause</p></br>
    <p>  Conditionals are also known as if clauses, we use them to say that one thing depends on something else. They can be used to talk about something that always happens, might happen or might have happened as a result of another state, action or event.</p></b>
    <h4>Conditional sentences</h4></b>
    <p>    A conditional sentence is a type of sentence that states a condition and the outcome of that condition occurring. Conditional sentences are made up of a dependent clause and an independent clause joined to express said condition. Complete conditional sentences contain a conditional clause (often referred to as the if-clause) and the consequence. Also conditional sentences are statements discussing known factors or hypothetical situations and their consequences. The order of the clauses can usually be reversed. Conditional sentences describe a conditional situation, or a result that depends on an event occurring first. "If" one thing happens, "then" another thing will happen.</p></b>
    <p>When a dependent or subordinate clause is introduced by words such as “if,” “when,” or “unless,” the complete sentence expresses a condition. The dependent or subordinate clause states a condition or cause and is joined with an independent clause, which states the result or effect. Conditional sentences can be factual, predictive, or speculative, which determines the form of the condition and the choice of verb tenses.</p></b>
